The `R2admb` package provides an interface between [R](http://www.r-project.org) and [AD Model Builder](http://admb-project.org).  There is a stable version on CRAN, and an old (2012 November) version on R-forge, but active development is now happening here on github.  In order to install the most recent development version, install the `devtools` package from CRAN and then:

```
library("devtools")
install_github("bbolker/R2admb",subdir="R2admb")
```
